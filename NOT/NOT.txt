Spring is a Dependency Injection framework to make java applications loosely coupled. 
Spring framework makes the development process easy for JavaEE applications. 
Spring enables you to build applications from "plain old Java objects" (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOS. 
Spring was developed by Rod Johnson in 2003.

In SpringBoot u have abstract layer over Spring framework.

In the Spring Framework, the IoC container is responsible for managing the components of an application and injecting dependencies into them. The container creates the objects (beans), wires them together, configures them, and manages their complete lifecycle.
